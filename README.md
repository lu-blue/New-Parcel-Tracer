# Parcel Tracker React App

This is my first project in React library which I developed during the Software Development Academy course (2021). 

## Features

Fetch parcel data from REST API.

Search a parcel by parcel-ID.

Sort a parcel list view by ETA and status.

View parcel details - brief and detailed view trigged by "View More" button.

View parcel location on an integrated map.

### Note:
Since the scope of the project is limited, the app shows how the pages look for an already logged in user.

## How to run application

### Requirements:

Node.js
GIT
Integrated development environment (IDE)

### Using GIT and IDE 

1. Open your IDE Terminal and open the directory in which you will store your new application.

2. Clone this app repository and pull a copy of it to use locally by writing a command in your terminal 

$ git clone https://github.com/lu-blue/New-Parcel-Tracer.git

3. Go into the cloned project folder and install the project dependencies by writing the following command:

$ npm install

4. Each time you want to run teh application, use the command:

$ npm start

This will start the app in the development mode, opening a browser where you will see how a finished app looks. You need to navigate to localhost to view it in the browser.
Usually it´s this: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). If you already run something else on this localhost, you´ll be asked to choose another route (y/n question).

 If you make edits, the browser may show errors. In order to avoid it, kill the terminal, save your changes and use the command npm start again.

### Dependencies needed to be installed before running the app

React router

Axios

Mapbox

## Enjoy!
